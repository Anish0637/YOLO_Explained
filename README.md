# YOLO_Explained
[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](LICENSE)  

Yolo is a fully convolutional model that, unlike many other scanning detection algorithms, generates bounding boxes in one pass. 
In this tutorial repo, you'll learn how exactly does Yolo work by analyzing a Tensorflow 2
implementation of the algorithm.

## Goals 
This project has two goals: 
1. Implement Yolo 2 in native TF2 that is usable out of box using the latest API such as tf.data.Dataset and tf.keras 
2. Provide detailed explanation, examples, and charts for people who want to understand Yolo 2

Environment
<pre>
tensorflow >=2.1.0
numpy >= 1.18.5
matplotlib >= 3.1.2
</pre>

## Tutorial Structure 
#### Jupyter Notebook Tutorials  
In these tutorials we are going to implement Yolo V2 step by step 
* **Tutorial 1**: understand the output format of Yolo V2
* **Tutorial 2**: convert the raw yolo output to a list of bounding boxes (Post Processing)
* **Tutorial 3**: how to create training labels from annotations such as Json or XML
* **Tutorial 4**: implementation of Yolo loss 
* **Tutorial 5**: capstone - use the previous steps to do transfer learning on a new dataset
